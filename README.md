CORD-19 Data Explorer
Overview

In this project I worked with the CORD-19 metadata dataset. The aim was to practice the basics of data analysis: loading data, cleaning it, doing some simple analysis, and making visualizations. I also prepared a small Streamlit app structure to show how the data can be presented interactively.

Tools I Used

Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn)

Google Colab (to write and run my code)

Streamlit (for the app structure)

GitHub (to submit my work)

What I Did

Data Loading and Cleaning

Loaded the metadata.csv file

Checked columns, missing values, and data types

Cleaned the dataset (dates, missing data)

Added a new column for abstract word count

Analysis and Visualizations

Number of publications by year

Top 10 journals that published the most papers

Distribution of abstract word counts

Streamlit App (Basic Structure)

Added a title and short description

Added a year range slider

Displayed some visualizations and a sample of the data

Results

Most COVID-19 papers were published in 2020â€“2021

A few journals published a big share of the research

Abstracts are usually short but vary in length

Reflection

Doing this assignment helped me understand the full process: from data loading, cleaning, and analysis, to visualization. The most challenging part was figuring out how to clean the data and deal with missing values. I learned to take things step by step, and it became easier to work with pandas and seaborn.
